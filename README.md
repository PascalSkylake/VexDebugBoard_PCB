# _VexDebugBoard PCB_

This is the main hardware repository for the V5 Debug Board: a board designed to slot into the VEX V5 Smart Port, 
and transmit debug data over a websocket to a laptop. The data is received by a [Foxglove application](https://foxglove.dev) instance, and allows for:

- 3D visualization of Odometry
- Real-time graphing for robot tuning
- Wireless print statements

This repository contains the circuit diagram, BOM and PCB layout for the board.
